# Meeting Room Booking System

This project is a web-based application developed as a Computer Science NEA for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in Crawley. It replaces the manual paper-based booking process with an automated system allowing staff to view, book, and manage meeting rooms in real-time, featuring role-based access, conflict prevention, and GDPR compliance.
